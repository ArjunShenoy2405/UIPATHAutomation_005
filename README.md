This process analyse an image and convert in into bitmap, collecting pixel coordinates and converting it into datatable. Later on, this data is treated as X-Y axis points.
X-Y axis points will be recognised and pixels are generated on such point in MS-Paint automatically by the system, resulting in the recreation of the same image along Y-axis.
